// v0.7.28 — Issue 31. Climate-robustness Decision Report section.
//
// Attached to SensitivityResult when the sweep was run with
// axis = climate_scenario and at least 2 scenarios were sampled. The
// section turns the table-of-rows the operator just received into a
// plain-language verdict their planning meeting can act on.
//
// Honest scope:
//   - Reads only quantities already in scope on a finished sweep
//     (per-scenario best-feasible code, baseline match, sweep verdict).
//   - Does NOT re-run any simulation or aggregate beyond the sweep
//     result.
//   - The ancestral-introgression paragraph is conditional on the
//     base request having included ancestral_introgression (i.e.
//     req.Base.AncestralIntroPercent > 0 AND strategy_set advanced).
//   - The honesty caveat is always present so the operator does not
//     mistake the population-uniform penalty for per-QTL tolerance
//     modelling.
